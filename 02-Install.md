Getting TypeScript installed
============================

To install TypeScript globally on your system, you gotta use [npm](https://npmjs.org/) (and if you're like me, you had to `sudo` this):

    npm install -g typescript

And you're done. If you want, you can get TypeScript support in [Visual Studio](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=266563) or [other editors](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled.aspx).

You can also [run TypeScript code in the playground](http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground/), which allows you to write code and run it without installing anything.
